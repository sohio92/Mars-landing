# Mars-landing
A genetic algorithm to land a shuttle on Mars, inspired by the codingame.com article: https://www.codingame.com/blog/genetic-algorithm-mars-lander/ 

Just execute main.py and let the magic happen !

Please note that the code is incomplete, classe_game/Game.evaluer only evaluates the distance to the landing spot, not the landing speed!
